      <p class="info-text">I have been learning to code for a year and a half and I have been enjoying the learning process. I am mainly learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Ruby. At the moment I am studying from Eloquent JavaScript and MDN guides. I have been doing yoga for many years, I draw and paint, photograph and like studying and doing art. I am learning martial arts, I do brazilian jiu jitsu and judo and karate and qi gong. I like to read, to play musical instruments and to climb and to listen to mountaineering podcasts üèî</p>

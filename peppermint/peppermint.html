        <p>Peppermint (Mentha Ã— piperita, also known as Mentha balsamea Wild)[1] is a hybrid mint, a cross between watermint and spearmint.[2] Indigenous to Europe and the Middle East,[3] the plant is now widely spread and cultivated in many regions of the world.[4] It is occasionally found in the wild with its parent species.[4][5]</p>

        <p>Although the genus Mentha comprises more than 25 species, the one in most common use is peppermint.[6] While Western peppermint is derived from Mentha Ã— piperita, Chinese peppermint, or bohe, is derived from the fresh leaves of M. haplocalyx.[7][8][9] M. Ã— piperita and M. haplocalyx are both recognized as plant sources of menthol and menthone, and are among the oldest herbs used for both culinary and medicinal products.[6][10] </p>
